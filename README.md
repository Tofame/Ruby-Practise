# Ruby Learning Projects

This repository is a collection of projects designed to help me broaden and deepen my skills in **Ruby**, in preparation of deepening knowledge of Ruby on Rails (both Restful as well as GraphQL web api development),
which will be done in separate repos.

## ðŸ§  Purpose

The goal of this repo is to:

- Strengthen foundational Ruby skills.
- Become aware of interesting stuff that Ruby implements (to me it was e.g. Module, Symbol, ERB)
