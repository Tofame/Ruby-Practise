# Ruby Learning Projects

This repository is a collection of projects designed to help me broaden and deepen my skills in **Ruby** and **Ruby on Rails**, focusing on both **RESTful** and **GraphQL** API development.

## ðŸ§  Purpose

The goal of this repo is to:

- Strengthen foundational Ruby skills.
- Gain hands-on experience building APIs with Ruby on Rails.
- Understand the architectural differences between REST and GraphQL APIs.

## ðŸ“¦ Projects

### 1. `Ruby-Basics` (WIP)

A simple group of project(s)/small part of codes, focused on bringing me closer to core Ruby syntax, concepts, and problem-solving.

### 2. `Ruby-FarmApi-Rest` (TO-DO)

A basic RESTful API built with Ruby on Rails simulating a simple farm management system.

### 3. `Ruby-FarmApi-GraphQL` (TO-DO)

A GraphQL-based version of the same farm management system using the `graphql-ruby` gem.
