### Some of the projects in here:
[Important-Concepts](./Important-Concepts) - whenever I learn a new programming language I like to delve deep
inside the details and interesting concepts - such as e.g. JS having bubbling and hoisting. In Ruby the thing that
initially grabbed my attention were ***Symbols***, currently as I'm writing it, I'm planning to look into **ERB**.

[Movie-Watchlist](./Movie-Watchlist) - the first Ruby "basics" project I came up with.
Instead of doing e.g. a 'Calculator' as many people do as their first language projects, I just did:
- Terminal app allowing to: Show All movies, Add/Remove/Edit managed ones. They are persistent since I write/read json file.

[Networking-PeopleChat](./Networking-PeopleChat) - networking basics -
I tested concurrency (threads) and TCP sockets to make simple chat
server that accepts clients (users) that can send messages and receive them.
To avoid race conditions mutex is used to remove/add from clients array.

[Basic-serialization](./Basic-serialization) - serialization basics while following things
from internet as well as [Ruby docs](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/index.html).
