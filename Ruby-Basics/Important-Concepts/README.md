### Reading [docs](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/index.html) and learning whatever sounds interesting
Currently what grabbed my attention are:
- Symbols
- ERB (cool templates system)
- Ruby resource management [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/214642/raii-in-ruby-or-how-to-manage-resources-in-ruby)

  In other languages I had 'try with resources', here it's either automatic (file) or we use 'ensure' block.
    
    I see people combine ```rescue/ensure with yield``` basically.
